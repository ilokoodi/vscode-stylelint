Unit tests are located in `__tests__` directories in [`src`](../../src) ([example](../../src/utils/__tests__)).

Mocks for Node modules are in the [`__mocks__`](../../__mocks__) directory of the project root, and mocks for local modules are in the `__mocks__` directory at the same level as the module being mocked ([example](../../src/utils/__mocks__)).
